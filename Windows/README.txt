This is just a simple hockey simulation program.

I'm not sure if it's all that accurate, but I just wanted
to be creative and program something that involves my 
favorite sport. 

The program will open up a menu where you can pick what
you want to do.

You will either pick from a database, or just do a quick
simulation of two teams that you will create.

Thanks,
